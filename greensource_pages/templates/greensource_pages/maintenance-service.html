            <p>We're committed to increasing the production of renewable energy and ensuring its long-term viability, hence
                our solar energy system is designed to expand its energy capacity as load demand rises. We have a team of
                qualified solar energy technicians on hand to attend to any upgrade and or maintenance of solar systems.
                Maintenance is needed for dependable and long-term energy output, as well as to ensure your system's optimal
                efficiency. Preventive and corrective maintenance are two forms of maintenance that we plan for our customers.
                We advice that all installations be subject maintenance to ensure that they last as long as possible and
                that they are running at peak performance. Cleaning solar panels, removing spent/burnt wires, cleaning batteries
                and replacing battery fluid for tubular batteries, air pressure cleaning of electrical components, and ensuring
                all cables are firmly fastened to their terminals are only a few of the maintenance tasks we conduct.
